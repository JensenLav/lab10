# Food Finder

## Brief Application description
    Food Finder an app that is designed to help you find the best food anywhere, with a focus on open discussion and user generated reviews and recommendations. The crowdsourced database of restaurants and reviews aims to be larger than its competition because of ease, and lack of restrictions when contributing to the app. Visitors to the website will be able to see reviews of any restaurant which they query, and add reviews of their own. It is possible that in future releases there will be an option to reply to reviews as well.
